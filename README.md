# Cooling Load Prediction App

This is a small web app that predicts how much cooling energy a building may require.
It uses a machine learning model trained on real building data and gives an instant estimate based on simple inputs like surface area, height, window glass area, and direction.

## Highlights

* Easy-to-use web interface
* Works on any phone or laptop
* Gives quick cooling load prediction
* Clean layout with a simple “Predict” button
* Shows which building features affect the cooling the most
* Model accuracy: **R² ≈ 0.97**, **MAE ≈ 1.08**

## Purpose

Made to clearly present a practical machine learning project in a simple way.
Good for demonstrating understanding of data, model building, and making a usable tool.

## How to Run (basic steps)

1. Install the required packages
2. Run the app with the command:
   `streamlit run app.py`
3. The app will open in your browser automatically.
